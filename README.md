# threejs-react-wrapper

Simple wrapper to run vanilla Threejs code inside a React component.

Using React 17.0.2 with functional components and hooks. React code based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (as of April 2021).

This template handles running regular ES6 Threejs code (as provided in the Threejs examples) inside a bigger React site. Handles loading / unloading and hot-reloads.

## Philosophy

[react-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) is great if you love React and want to write your 3D code with JSX and hooks. If you prefer coding Threejs with vanilla JS / ES6 classes / modules, this template might be useful for you.
